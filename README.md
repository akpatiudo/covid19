### Overview:
This project conducts a comprehensive data analysis of COVID-19 cases in Africa from January 2020 to May 2023 using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) and Tableau. The dataset was obtained from www.ourworldindata.org and comprises 307,831 entries and 66 columns. The analysis aims to provide insights into various aspects of the pandemic's impact on the continent, including total cases, deaths, vaccination rates, and hospitalization trends.

Steps Taken:
Database Creation: A database named 'portfolio' was created in SQL Server, along with a table named 'projects'.
Data Importation: The dataset was split into two files, 'covidDeath$' and 'covidVaccinations$', and imported into the 'portfolio' database to facilitate efficient analysis.
Data Exploration: Common Table Expressions (CTEs) were utilized to filter and narrow down the dataset to focus on African continent-specific data.
Data Analysis: Various SQL queries were executed to analyze different aspects of the COVID-19 data, including total cases, deaths, death rates, highest case counts by country, vaccination percentages, and hospitalization statistics.
Visualization: Tableau was employed for data visualization to provide clear insights derived from the SQL analysis.

### Key Findings:
Total COVID-19 cases in Africa amounted to approximately 8.63 billion, with 188.8 million deaths and a death rate of 2.19%.
South Africa, Morocco, and Tunisia reported the highest number of cases, while Seychelles, Reunion, and Mauritius had the highest percentage of cases by population.
Analysis of vaccination data revealed variations in vaccination rates across African countries, with Seychelles leading in the percentage of fully vaccinated people.
Visualization highlighted trends such as the impact of temperature on case numbers, monthly fluctuations in new cases and deaths, and disparities in hospitalization records across countries.

### Conclusion:
The analysis provides valuable insights into the spread and management of COVID-19 in Africa, highlighting regional disparities in infection rates, vaccination efforts, and healthcare infrastructure. Despite challenges such as data inconsistencies and limited hospital records, the project underscores the importance of data-driven approaches in understanding and addressing public health crises.
